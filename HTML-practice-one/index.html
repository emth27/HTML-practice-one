        <h1>HTML Practice</h1>
        <p>This is an HTML practice webpage. This covers what I have been learning so far on the <a
                href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/" target="_blank">Complete Intro
                to Web Development, v3</a>.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>There are a total of 6 level headings. Level 1 being the largest in text size to level 6 being the smallest
            in
            size.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>This sentence was created with the p element. The p element has an opening and closing tag. Without the
            opening
            and closing tag the text will display, but the code will be incorrect.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Anchor</h2>
        <p>The anchor element is what is used to create links. Links are used to link within the same webpage, website,
            or link to other websites. When you use the target attribute with the value of "blank", the link opens up in
            a new tab on the browser you are using. If you want to learn more about links, <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a> is a great resource and has examples
            to help you understand how links work and more.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Divs</h2>
        <p>Divs are used as containers in HTML. You do not see their full effect until they are used with <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a> to be
            styled.</p>
        <p>Throughout this webpage, I am using divs to organize my content.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>Lists can be used for grocery list or to list steps in order. Lists can also have list within itself.</p>
        <p>This is an example of an ordered list with an unordered list within itself. Ordered list use numbers.</p>

        <h2>Buttons</h2>
        <p>This is a simple button. It has no function at the moment. It is just for show.</p>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>Images can be used throughout your webpage or website. They can be linked externally or internally. Meaning,
            one can be an image link from unsplash, google images, or other image websites. Internally would be an image
            that you have uploaded to use for your webpage or website.</p>

        <p>An example of a website using a link to display. I used the src attribute with the value being an image from
            X. The alt attibute was used to describe what the image is about. Along with using the width attribute
            giving it a vaule of 400.</p>
        <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GEY587KXQAAnM_a?format=jpg&name=large"
            alt="Real Madrid celebrate a last minute goal" width="400">
        <p>This an example of an image I have downloaded that I am using from an image folder in VS Code. I have also
            used
            the src attribute, alt attribute to describe the image, and the width attibute to give the image a value of
            400. I also used figure and figcaption to give credit to the photographer of the image.</p>
